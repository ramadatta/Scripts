Many times, I had to submit either Nucleotide pr Protein sequence to KEGG KAAS and felt immense pain arranging the data in the usable and understandable format.
Here is the script I wrote to understand and generate the Results, more easily, quickly in seconds.!!
Hope this is useful for the community!!

Descrption: This script makes a table taking collapsed file, query.ko files as the inputs after Kegg-KAAS run	and generates a table	

Dependencies: The folder running this script should also have the sister files
